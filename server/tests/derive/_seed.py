"""Deterministic synthetic dataset for the derive parity tests.

Copied from healthee@049c9ad (tests/derive/_seed.py); the golden fixture was produced from
exactly these rows, so they must stay byte-identical. No random:
every value is a closed-form function of the day index, so the fixture is
reproducible on any machine.

Eight consecutive local (Asia/Kolkata) days, each with: a main sleep session +
per-minute overnight HR / periodic HRV·SpO2·RR, a morning moderate walk + a short
vigorous burst (per-minute steps), daytime per-minute HR, and one workout mid-week.
This exercises rhr, the night vitals, SRI + the 4-dim sleep score, sleep debt,
steps/distance/calories, MVPA, Jurca VO2max, cardio load, and recovery.
