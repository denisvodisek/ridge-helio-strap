Nights and days are derived oldest first, in two-week chunks, one transaction per chunk, so
every baseline (recovery's 42 days, sleep debt's 14 nights) is built from days already
derived. Only days that HAVE raw data are derived — the same rule ingest follows (a sample,
a sleep session's start or end date, a workout, a counter reading). A contiguous range
would hand every unworn day a whole-day calorie estimate made from nothing.
