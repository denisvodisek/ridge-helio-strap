"""Daily energy expenditure (calories) — free-living, MET-by-state, BMR-anchored.

Total EE is built minute-by-minute from a MET assigned to each minute's state
(walking from steps via ACSM | asleep | awake-NEAT), anchored so 1 MET == BMR/min
(Mifflin-St Jeor). Heart rate is deliberately NOT used for free-living EE — without
raw accelerometry it can't separate awake-rest from activity and overcounts. Ported
verbatim from legacy v2. Knowledge: [[energy_expenditure_derivation]].

## The weight behind BMR is CAVEATED, not withheld (#127)

All three metrics rest on a Mifflin-St Jeor BMR, and its mass is the owner's last logged
weight — which can be arbitrarily old. Until #127 this module never asked how old, so a
calorie figure served today could rest on a mass measured months ago and say nothing
about it. That is the same stale-as-current class ``derive/vo2max.py`` and
``read/today_series.py`` already close for weight; the rule was simply not held here.

**The question is the shared one and the horizon is the shared constant** —
``freshness.weight_is_stale``, ``WEIGHT_MAX_AGE_DAYS``. It is the same quantity being
asked about (is this logged mass a statement about this day's body?), so a second horizon
would be a second definition of one metric's currency, which is the failure
``derive/freshness.py``'s docstring exists to prevent. #117's
``MEASURED_VO2MAX_MAX_AGE_DAYS`` is deliberately NOT this constant because it asks about
a different quantity — fitness, not mass. Here the quantity is mass.

**The ANSWER differs from ``vo2max.py``'s, and the difference is argued, not assumed.**
Three reasons, in the order that decided it:

1. *The tilt is bounded, and the bound is provable.* Total EE is
   ``k·BMR + workout_cal`` where ``k = Σ MET_minute / 1440`` and the workout term is the
   device's own measurement; both are weight-free. So for every one of the three metrics
   the RELATIVE error a wrong mass induces is at most
   :data:`MIFFLIN_KCAL_PER_KG_DAY` ``· Δkg / BMR`` — about **0.6% per kilogram** at a
   1639 kcal BMR, equal at ``basal_calories`` and strictly smaller wherever a workout
   contributes. It would take **~25 kg** of undetected drift to reach the ±15-20%
   individual error this estimate already advertises [Brage 2015,
   [[energy_expenditure_derivation]]]. There is no elapsed interval for which any
   evidence we hold predicts that. #117 set the shape of this test — drift against the
   instrument's own resolution — and applied here it never crosses.
2. *The tilt has no direction.* #117's tie-breaker was that detraining decay makes a held
   VO₂max read HIGH, i.e. flatter, which is the #108 failure. Body mass in free living
   has no such signed decay: 0.26 ± 1.2 kg over two weeks, a mean swamped by its own
   spread [Bhutani et al. 2017, [[weight_bmi_body_composition]]]. A stale weight is as
   likely to under-report this owner's burn as to over-report it.
3. *The corpus already ruled on exactly this, and asked for the disclosure it never got.*
   [[weight_bmi_body_composition]] Honesty says ``derive/energy.py`` is deliberately
   unchanged by #85 and why; its Coach Directive 6 says to name the weight's date
   "whenever weight is used to justify anything". No payload carried one, so the
   directive was unsatisfiable. That — not the arithmetic — is what #127 fixes.

So the weight's provenance ships on ALL THREE metrics unconditionally, and past the
horizon a ``caveats`` entry says which way the number leans. Nothing is withheld and no
number moves: withholding a whole day's calories over a lean this size would be a refusal
no evidence asked for, and "not enough data" only beats a guess when there is a guess.
